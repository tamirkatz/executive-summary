The API includes citations for all the information it retrieves, ensuring you know exactly where the data comes from.\n\nWhat is GPT Researcher, and how does it relate to Tavily?\n\nGPT Researcher is an open-source, autonomous agent powered by Tavily’s Search API.

Strands scales from simple to complex agent use cases, and from local development to deployment in production. Multiple teams at AWS already use Strands for their AI agents in production, including Amazon Q Developer, AWS Glue, and VPC Reachability Analyzer. Now, I’m thrilled to share Strands with you for building your own AI agents. Compared with frameworks that require developers to define complex workflows for their agents, Strands simplifies agent development by embracing the capabilities of state-of-the-art models to plan, chain thoughts, call tools, and reflect. With Strands, developers can simply define a prompt and a list of tools in code to build an agent, then test it locally and deploy it to the cloud. Like the two strands of DNA, Strands connects two core pieces of the agent together: the model and the tools. Strands plans the agent’s next steps and executes tools using the advanced reasoning capabilities of models. For more complex agent use cases, developers can customize their agent’s behavior in Strands. For example, you can specify how tools are selected, customize how context is managed, choose where session state and memory are stored, and build multi-agent applications. Strands can run anywhere and can support any model with reasoning and tool use capabilities, including models in Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, Ollama, Meta, and other providers through LiteLLM. Strands Agents is an open community, and we’re excited that several companies are joining us with support and contributions including Accenture, Anthropic, Langfuse, mem0.ai, Meta, PwC, Ragas.io, and Tavily. For instance, Anthropic has already contributed support in Strands for using models through the Anthropic API, and Meta contributed support for Llama models through Llama API. Join us on GitHub to get started with Strands Agents! Our journey building agents I primarily work on Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered assistant for software development. My team and I started building AI agents in early 2023, around when the original ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) scientific paper was published. This paper showed that large language models could reason, plan, and take actions in their environment. For example, LLMs could reason that they needed to make an API call to complete a task and then generate the inputs needed for that API call. We then realized that large language models could be used as agents to complete many types of tasks, including complex software development and operational troubleshooting. At that time, LLMs weren’t typically trained to act like agents. They were often trained primarily for natural language conversation. Successfully using an LLM to reason and act required complex prompt instructions on how to use tools, parsers for the model’s responses, and orchestration logic. Simply getting LLMs to reliably produce syntactically correct JSON was a challenge at the time! To prototype and deploy agents, my team and I relied on a variety of complex agent framework libraries that handled the scaffolding and orchestration needed for the agents to reliably succeed at their tasks with these earlier models. Even with these frameworks, it would take us months of tuning and tweaking to get an agent ready for production. Since then, we’ve seen a dramatic improvement in large language models’ abilities to reason and use tools to complete tasks. We realized that we no longer needed such complex orchestration to build agents, because models now have native tool-use and reasoning capabilities. In fact, some of the agent framework libraries we had been using to build our agents started to get in our way of fully leveraging the capabilities of newer LLMs. Even though LLMs were getting dramatically better, those improvements didn’t mean we could build and iterate on agents any faster with the frameworks we were using. It still took us months to make an agent production-ready. We started building Strands Agents to remove this complexity for our teams in Q Developer. We found that relying on the latest models’ capabilities to drive agents significantly reduced our time to market and improved the end user experience, compared to building agents with complex orchestration logic. Where it used to take months for Q Developer teams to go from prototype to production with a new agent, we’re now able to ship new agents in days and weeks with Strands. Core concepts of Strands Agents The simplest definition of an agent is a combination of three things: 1) a model, 2) tools, and 3) a prompt. The agent uses these three components to complete a task, often autonomously. The agent’s task could be to answer a question, generate code, plan a vacation, or optimize your financial portfolio. In a model-driven approach, the agent uses the model to dynamically direct its own steps and to use tools in order to accomplish the specified task. To define an agent with the Strands Agents SDK, you define these three components in code: 1. Model: Strands offers flexible model support. You can use any model in Amazon Bedrock that supports tool use and streaming, a model from Anthropic’s Claude model family through the Anthropic API, a model from the Llama model family via Llama API, Ollama for local development, and many other model providers such as OpenAI through LiteLLM. You can additionally define your own custom model provider with Strands. 2. Tools: You can choose from thousands of published Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to use as tools for your agent. Strands also provides 20+ pre-built example tools, including tools for manipulating files, making API requests, and interacting with AWS APIs. You can easily use any Python function as a tool, by simply using the Strands @tool decorator. 3. Prompt: You provide a natural language prompt that defines the task for your agent, such as answering a question from an end user. You can also provide a system prompt that provides general instructions and desired behavior for the agent. An agent interacts with its model and tools in a loop until it completes the task provided by the prompt. This agentic loop is at the core of Strands’ capabilities. The Strands agentic loop takes full advantage of how powerful LLMs have become and how well they can natively reason, plan, and select tools. In each loop, Strands invokes the LLM with the prompt and agent context, along with a description of your agent’s tools. The LLM can choose to respond in natural language for the agent’s end user, plan out a series of steps, reflect on the agent’s previous steps, and/or select one or more tools to use. When the LLM selects a tool, Strands takes care of executing the tool and providing the result back to the LLM. When the LLM completes its task, Strands returns the agent’s final result. In Strands’ model-driven approach, tools are key to how you customize the behavior of your agents. For example, tools can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base, call APIs, run Python logic, or just simply return a static string that contains additional model instructions. Tools also help you achieve complex use cases in a model-driven approach, such as with these Strands Agents example pre-built tools: Retrieve tool: This tool implements semantic search using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. Beyond retrieving documents, the retrieve tool can also help the model plan and reason by retrieving other tools using semantic search. For example, one internal agent at AWS has over 6,000 tools to select from! Models today aren’t capable of accurately selecting from quite that many tools. Instead of describing all 6,000 tools to the model, the agent uses semantic search to find the most relevant tools for the current task and describes only those tools to the model. You can implement this pattern by storing many tool descriptions in a knowledge base and letting the model use the retrieve tool to retrieve a subset of relevant tools for the current task. Thinking tool: This tool prompts the model to do deep analytical thinking through multiple cycles, enabling sophisticated thought processing and self-reflection as part of the agent. In the model-driven approach, modeling thinking as a tool enables the model to reason about if and when a task needs deep analysis. Multi-agent tools like the workflow, graph, and swarm tools: For complex tasks, Strands can orchestrate across multiple agents in a variety of multi-agent collaboration patterns. By modeling sub-agents and multi-agent collaboration as tools, the model-driven approach enables the model to reason about if and when a task requires a defined workflow, graph, or swarm of sub-agents. Strands support for the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol for multi-agent applications is coming soon.\n\nLearn more by requesting a demo\n\n### Tavily Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n*   When was Tavily founded?\n\nTavily was founded in 2023.\n\n*   Where is Tavily's headquarters?\n\nTavily's headquarters is located at 315 West 36th Street, New York.\n\n*   Who are Tavily's competitors?\n\nCompetitors of Tavily include Dashworks, Klart AI, Instabase, Hercules, IKI AI and 7 more.\n\n[![Image 10: New call-to-action](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/763793/44dc5cae-a986-48aa-996a-34cb6eef5c03.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/763793/44dc5cae-a986-48aa-996a-34cb6eef5c03?__hstc=168719870.b6de7ef7b61aafc85a09a71d316fd4e1.1750104727522.1750104727522.1750104727522.1&__hssc=168719870.1.1750104727522&__hsfp=3742643765)\n\nCompare Tavily to Competitors\n-----------------------------\n\n![Image 11: Glean Logo](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cbi-image-service-prd/original/8bd6d4bd-b376-4681-b438-61e45ca5ba65.png)\n\n[Glean](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/glean-2)\nGlean operates as an enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) platform that provides tools for workplace productivity across various sectors.

AI agents now autonomously retrieve and analyze live data, advancing research, data enrichment, and automated decision-making. However, as these systems become more autonomous, ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and security of the data they process is more critical than ever. AI agents are particularly vulnerable to indirect injection attacks, where hidden malicious commands are embedded within seemingly normal data, posing significant risks.\n\nThat’s why we’re excited to announce our **strategic partnership with**[**Pillar Security**](https://www.pillar.security/?ref=blog.tavily.com), a pioneering company in AI security, to deliver safe, secure, and enterprise-ready AI search and web access. By integrating Tavily’s best-in-class web access layer for AI agents with Pillar’s advanced security guardrails, we’re establishing a new standard for trustworthy, proactive, and reliable AI-powered retrieval.\n\n**Ensuring Secure, Trustworthy AI Retrieval**\n---------------------------------------------\n\nTavily and Pillar Security are establishing a new industry benchmark by ensuring that AI agents not only access real-time web data but do so securely and without risk of manipulation.\n\nSince AI models are only as reliable as the data they retrieve, unverified or manipulated sources can introduce misinformation, skewed insights, or unintended behaviors. As AI agents interact with an ever-growing range of web sources, it is essential to safeguard against these risks at the foundation.\n\nThis partnership directly addresses one of AI’s biggest challenges: ensuring safe, accurate, and security-enhanced real-time information retrieval. While many AI search tools focus solely on access, Tavily + Pillar goes further by embedding security at the core—making it the most trusted, enterprise-ready solution for AI-powered web access.\n\n**Why This Partnership Matters for AI Builders**\n------------------------------------------------\n\nOrganizations deploying AI agents must safeguard internal data while ensuring that externally sourced information is accurate, safe, and free from manipulation.\n\n### **Bridging the AI Security Gap:**\n\n*   Web scraping, real-time search, and RAG pipelines can expose AI systems to malicious content and manipulation.\n*   Enterprises require more than just accuracy—security, compliance, and data integrity are now critical differentiators.\n*   Tavily + Pillar ensures only verified, high-quality, and structured data reaches AI systems, allowing teams to build with confidence and precision.\n\n**How Tavily + Pillar Work Together**\n-------------------------------------\n\nOur partnership brings together the best of real-time AI web access and AI-native security:\n\n### **Tavily: Trusted, Real-Time Web Access for AI Agents**\n\n*   Provides real-time, high-fidelity web access—including search, structured scraping, and data processing—optimized for AI applications.\n*   Ensures factual, relevant, and up-to-date information tailored for AI-driven workflows.\n*   Powers AI retrieval pipelines with trusted, structured, and RAG-ready results.\n\n### **Pillar Security: Adaptive Protection for AI Data Integrity**\n\n*   Monitors, detects, and neutralizes potential risks in real time—preventing AI models from consuming misleading or manipulated content.\n*   Safeguards against prompt injections, data poisoning, misinformation, and system compromise.\n*   Integrates seamlessly into AI pipelines, ensuring security without slowing down performance.\n\n### **The Result?**\n\nA seamlessly integrated, enterprise-grade AI web access experience—where security is built-in, not bolted on.\n\n**What This Means for AI Teams & Enterprises**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n### **For AI Developers:**\n\n*   No more trade-offs between speed, accuracy, and security—Tavily ensures safe retrieval at the source.\n\n### **For Enterprises:**\n\n*   Enterprise-grade compliance and security for AI applications.\n*   Reduced risk exposure in AI-powered decision-making.\n*   A scalable, production-ready search API that meets security and compliance requirements.\n\n### **For AI-Native Startups & Builders:**\n\n*   A proactive security approach that future-proofs AI applications against evolving threats.\n\n**Looking Ahead: The Future of Secure AI Retrieval**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAI agents are becoming more autonomous, interconnected, and responsible for high-stakes decisions. As they continue to evolve, one thing is clear: **Security cannot be an afterthought—it must be embedded into the infrastructure of AI web tools**.\n\nTavily and Pillar Security are leading the charge to ensure AI systems remain factual, trusted, and protected at scale.\n\n**About Tavily**\n----------------\n\nTavily is a comprehensive web access layer for AI agents, offering real-time search, structured web scraping, and data processing at scale.

Tavily’s mission is to power AI systems with trusted, actionable data—enhancing the accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of AI-driven content and decision-making.\n\n**About Pillar Security**\n-------------------------\n\nPillar Security is a unified, end-to-end AI security platform that empowers organizations to launch and manage AI-powered applications with confidence. By embedding robust security measures throughout the entire AI lifecycle— from development to runtime—Pillar ensures that your AI initiatives are shielded from data breaches and non-compliance risks.

The different steps and components of this code are explained in more detail in the API Methods section further down.\n\n### Getting and printing the full Search API response\n\nfrom tavily import TavilyClient\n\n# Step 1. Instantiating your TavilyClient\ntavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")\n\n# Step 2. Executing a simple search query\nresponse = tavily_client.search("Who is Leo Messi?")\n\n# Step 3. That\'s it! You\'ve done a Tavily Search!\nprint(response)\n\nThis is equivalent to directly querying our REST API.\n\n### Generating context for a RAG Application\n\nfrom tavily import TavilyClient\n\n# Step 1. Instantiating your TavilyClient\ntavily_client = TavilyClient(api_key="tvly-YOUR_API_KEY")\n\n# Step 2.

By combining the intelligence of IBM’s advanced LLMs with Tavily’s real-time data infrastructure, teams can build AI applications that are secure, production-ready, and grounded in current, trusted knowledge—unlocking deeper insight and reasoning at scale.\n\n3 key benefits of this integration\n----------------------------------\n\nEnterprises need more than just powerful models—they need outputs grounded in reality, tailored to their context and compliant with evolving governance standards. That’s where this integration shines.\n\nTavily—a search platform optimized for LLMs and autonomous agents—enables real-time access to web data, closing the gap between static models and the dynamic world they operate in. Its powerful search, extraction and crawl APIs deliver high-fidelity web data in real time, designed from the ground up for seamless LLM integration.\n\nBy combining IBM watsonx.ai’s Granite foundation models with Tavily’s real-time web search APIs, organizations can:\n\n1.   **Ground AI outputs in current and verifiable information**, bridging the knowledge cutoff of static LLMs.\n2.   **Enhance auditability and trust** through transparent source citations for every enriched output.\n3.   **Accelerate workflows at scale**, with high-speed research and enrichment—powering agents and automation with real-time insights in seconds.**Adapt to any enterprise environment**, thanks to an open, flexible architecture that supports proprietary data, custom search parameters and model-agnostic design.\n\nThis integration reflects IBM’s commitment to building responsible, production-ready AI—and Tavily’s mission to make the web truly usable for intelligent systems.\n\nEmpowering Intelligent Search\n-----------------------------\n\nTavily offers a suite of web data APIs, including real-time [web search](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/search), [web scraping](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/extract), [web crawling](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/api-reference/endpoint/crawl) and document summarization. Key features include:\n\n*   **Real-time access and navigation of** public web information\n*   **Advanced extraction** capabilities to retrieve and structure data\n*   **Customizable search parameters** including time-range, web domains, and more\n*   **Privacy-first design** with secure, compliant handling of data, zero data retention, and PII redaction\n*   **Enterprise-grade security** for detection and mitigation of prompt injection\n\nUnlocking new enterprise use cases\n----------------------------------\n\nBy merging LLMs with real-time web data, enterprises can unlock numerous innovative use cases, including but not limited to:\n\n1.   **Market research teams** can quickly populate company profiles with live revenue estimates, market expansion news, leadership changes and relevant articles sourced from the web (see [example](https://companyresearcher.tavily.com/)here).\n2.   **Finance teams** can track real-time stock updates, competitor news or regulatory filings to stay ahead without switching between tools.\n3.   **Business analysts** can enrich CRM data with firmographic insights, enhancing lead qualification and personalization.\n\nThese [use cases](https://app.tavily.com/use-cases) are just the beginning. To empower developers and teams to build and extend these workflows, we’ve made the project open-source and highly customizable.\n\nBuilding in the open\n--------------------\n\nThis open-source project provides a reference architecture for enterprises aiming to implement agentic enrichment workflows at scale. Each column can be designed as a standalone agentic unit, enabling customized processing—from simple lookups to deep, contextual analysis—based on the specific requirements of the task.\n\nThe architecture is fully extensible, allowing teams to adapt it to industry-specific use cases, proprietary data sources, or internal compliance needs. We hope IBMers and the broader enterprise community draw inspiration from this work to build powerful, production-ready enrichment solutions across verticals.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n**1. Input Spreadsheet:** Users begin by populating a spreadsheet with entities or prompts requiring enrichment.\n\n**2.****Real-time Search:** Tavily's API fetches fresh, reliable web data.\n\n**3. LLM Processing:** IBM's Granite model processes, extracts, and structures the information\n\n**4.****Enrichment and export:** The enriched data is populated into the spreadsheet, complete with source citations, and can be exported as a CSV file.\n\n**Architecture Diagram:**\n\nA significant step for intelligent data\n---------------------------------------\n\nThe partnership between IBM and Tavily represents a significant step forward for intelligent data enrichment workflows. By combining Tavily's precision search APIs with the powerful natural language understanding of IBM's watsonx.ai Granite models, organizations can unlock smarter, real-time insights at scale directly within their daily spreadsheets.\n\nExperience the power of this integration yourself by exploring the open-source project and demo available on GitHub.\n\n[Demo Video](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/partnerships/IBM)\n\n[Explore the GitHub Project](https://github.com/tavily-ai/watsonx-tavily-spreadsheets)\n\n[Tavily Product Overview](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/about)\n\n Learn more [Tavily Product Overview](https://docs.tavily.com/documentation/about)[Discover Tavily’s Search API](https://www.tavily.com/)[Spreadsheet Enrichment Open-Source Repository](https://github.com/tavily-ai/watsonx-tavily-spreadsheets)\n\nProducts Consulting services Industries Case studies Financing Research LinkedIn X Instagram YouTube Podcasts Business partners Documentation Events Subscription center Support TechXchange community Overview Careers Investor relations Leadership Newsroom Security, privacy and trust United States — English Contact IBM Privacy Terms of use Accessibility\n"}, 'https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tavily_excited-to-announce-our-strategic-partnership-activity-7297986221199269889-5a-P': {'title': 'Driving smarter data enrichment: IBM and Tavily Partner for Agentic AI', 'content': "By combining the intelligence of IBM’s advanced LLMs with Tavily’s real-time data infrastructure, teams can build AI applications that are secure, production-ready, and grounded in current, trusted knowledge—unlocking deeper insight and reasoning at scale.

web exploration and data retrieval. While these capabilities unlock unprecedented potential, they also introduce critical security risks. As AI systems become more autonomous, they face an increasing risk of indirect injection attacks - where malicious instructions are embedded within seemingly innocuous data.\n\n\u200d\n\nThat’s why we’re thrilled to announce our strategic partnership with [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) - a leading web access layer designed specifically for AI agents—which delivers real-time, accurate, and factual results to more than 200,000 AI builders worldwide.\n\n\u200d\n\nBy integrating Pillar’s adaptive guardrails with Tavily’s web access layer for AI agents, we’re establishing a new standard for trustworthy, proactive, and reliable AI-powered retrieval.\n\n\u200d\n\n**Transforming AI Security for agentic systems**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n#### \u200d\n\n#### \u200d**Addressing the Threat of Indirect Injection Attacks**\n\nOrganizations deploying AI agents must safeguard internal data while ensuring that externally sourced information is accurate, safe, and free from manipulation.\n\nSince AI models are only as reliable as the data they retrieve, these risks grow as AI agents connect with an ever-expanding network of data sources, potentially leading to indirect injection attacks that lead to:\n\n*   **Data Leaks:** Unauthorized exposure of sensitive information.\n*   **Misinformation:** Propagation of manipulated or false data.\n*   **System Compromise:** Altered AI behavior that undermines system integrity.\n\nOur collaboration with Tavily enables us to counter these risks head-on. By integrating Pillar’s advanced security guardrails directly into Tavily’s engines, we ensure that only verified, secure data reaches end-users and models in real time.\n\n#### \u200d\n\n![Image 46](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66323b8546af4dde084f1170/67b59bbb5d6a4ecce197adb7_Indirect%20Injection%20Attacks%20via%20web%20access%20(2).png)\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n![Image 47](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66323b8546af4dde084f1170/67b59be18e7da07da0b2424f_Indirect%20Injection%20Attacks%20via%20web%20access%20(3).png)\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **Runtime AI Protection Powered by Real-World Threat Intelligence**\n\nAt Pillar Security, our proprietary models leverage insights from adversarial AI research, enriched by monitoring thousands of AI-powered applications in production and analyzing millions of multi-lingual model interactions across multiple use cases.\n\nThis real-world threat intelligence enables us to:\n\n*   **Anticipate Emerging Threats**\n*   **Deliver Proactive & Precise Protection**\n*   **Ensure Compliance and Integrity**\n\n\u200d\n\n**Pillar + Tavily: Key Benefits for AI Teams**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n\u200d\n\n1.   **Safe Data Retrieval**: Tavily’s Search and Extract APIs ensure that potentially harmful data is intercepted at the source, preventing dangerous content from ever reaching or affecting your AI systems.\n2.   **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Pillar’s advanced security guardrails operate continuously in the background, detecting and neutralizing threats as they arise to maintain compliance and system integrity.\n3.   **Streamlined Security Integration:** With proactive, built-in protection from both Pillar and Tavily, AI builders can focus on innovation without the burden of reactive, late-stage security fixes.\n\nThis partnership empowers enterprises to accelerate their AI solutions into production confidently, knowing that their systems are shielded by multiple layers of security.\n\n\u200d\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n-----------------\n\nThe Pillar-Tavily partnership is setting a new industry benchmark by combining state-of-the-art security with trusted data filtering capabilities. As AI systems become more interconnected and autonomous, the integrity of data—and the security measures protecting it—are more critical than ever.\n\nTogether, we are paving the way for the next generation of safe and reliable agentic systems\n\n\u200d\n\n\u200d\n\n#### **About Pillar Security**\n\nPillar Security is a unified, end-to-end AI security platform that empowers organizations to launch and manage AI-powered applications with confidence.

Head to our [Quickstart guide](/guides/quickstart) and start coding!\n\n## [\u200b](#who-are-we%3F) Who are we?\n\nWe’re a team of AI researchers and developers passionate about helping you build the next generation of AI assistants.\nOur mission is to empower individuals and organizations with accurate, unbiased, and factual information.\n\n## [\u200b](#what-is-the-tavily-search-engine%3F) What is the Tavily Search Engine?\n\nBuilding an AI agent that leverages realtime online information is not a simple task. Scraping doesn’t scale and requires expertise to refine, current search engine APIs don’t provide explicit information to queries but simply potential related articles (which are not always related), and are not very customziable for AI agent needs. This is why we’re excited to introduce the first search engine for AI agents - [Tavily](https://app.tavily.com).\n\nTavily is a search engine optimized for LLMs, aimed at efficient, quick and persistent search results. Unlike other search APIs such as Serp or Google, Tavily focuses on optimizing search for AI developers and autonomous AI agents. We take care of all the burden of searching, scraping, filtering and extracting the most relevant information from online sources. All in a single API call!\n\nTo try the API in action, you can now use our hosted version on our [API Playground](https://app.tavily.com/playground).\n\nIf you’re an AI developer looking to integrate your application with our API, or seek increased API limits, [please reach out!](mailto:support@tavily.com)\n\n## [\u200b](#why-choose-tavily%3F) Why choose Tavily?\n\nTavily shines where others fail, with a Search API optimized for LLMs.\n\nPurpose-Built\n\nTailored just for LLM Agents, we ensure the search results are optimized for [RAG](https://towardsdatascience.com/retrieval-augmented-generation-intuitively-and-exhaustively-explain-6a39d6fe6fc9). We take care of all the burden in searching, scraping, filtering and extracting information from online sources. All in a single API call! Simply pass the returned search results as context to your LLM.\n\nVersatility\n\nBeyond just fetching results, the Tavily Search API offers precision. With customizable search depths, domain management, and parsing HTML content controls, you’re in the driver’s seat.\n\nPerformance\n\nCommitted to speed and efficiency, our API guarantees real-time and trusted information. Our team works hard to improve Tavily’s performance over time.\n\nIntegration-friendly\n\nWe appreciate the essence of adaptability. That’s why integrating our API with your existing setup is a breeze. You can choose our [Python library](https://pypi.org/project/tavily-python/), [JavaScript package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tavily/core) or a simple API call. You can also use Tavily through any of our supported partners such as [LangChain](/integrations/langchain) and [LlamaIndex](/integrations/llamaindex).\n\nTransparent & Informative\n\nOur detailed documentation ensures you’re never left in the dark. From setup basics to nuanced features, we’ve got you covered.\n\n## [\u200b](#how-does-the-search-api-work%3F) How does the Search API work?\n\nTraditional search APIs such as Google, Serp and Bing retrieve search results based on a user query. However, the results are sometimes irrelevant to the goal of the search, and return simple URLs and snippets of content which are not always relevant. Because of this, any developer would need to then scrape the sites to extract relevant content, filter irrelevant information, optimize the content to fit LLM context limits, and more. This task is a burden and requires a lot of time and effort to complete. The Tavily Search API takes care of all of this for you in a single API call.\n\nThe Tavily Search API aggregates up to 20 sites per a single API call, and uses proprietary AI to score, filter and rank the top most relevant sources and content to your task, query or goal.\nIn addition, Tavily allows developers to add custom fields such as context and limit response tokens to enable the optimal search experience for LLMs.\n\nTavily can also help your AI agent make better decisions by including a short answer for cross-agent communication.\n\nWith LLM hallucinations, it’s crucial to optimize for RAG with the right context and information. This is where Tavily comes in, delivering accurate and precise information for your RAG applications.\n\n## [\u200b](#getting-started) Getting started\n\n[Sign up](https://app.tavily.com) for Tavily to get your API key.

Strands Agents is an open source SDK that takes a model-driven approach to building and running AI agents in just a few lines of code. Strands scales from simple to complex agent use cases, and from local development to deployment in production. Multiple teams at AWS already use Strands for their AI agents in production, including Amazon Q Developer, AWS Glue, and VPC Reachability Analyzer. Now, I’m thrilled to share Strands with you for building your own AI agents. Compared with frameworks that require developers to define complex workflows for their agents, Strands simplifies agent development by embracing the capabilities of state-of-the-art models to plan, chain thoughts, call tools, and reflect. With Strands, developers can simply define a prompt and a list of tools in code to build an agent, then test it locally and deploy it to the cloud. Like the two strands of DNA, Strands connects two core pieces of the agent together: the model and the tools. Strands plans the agent’s next steps and executes tools using the advanced reasoning capabilities of models. For more complex agent use cases, developers can customize their agent’s behavior in Strands. For example, you can specify how tools are selected, customize how context is managed, choose where session state and memory are stored, and build multi-agent applications. Strands can run anywhere and can support any model with reasoning and tool use capabilities, including models in Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, Ollama, Meta, and other providers through LiteLLM. Strands Agents is an open community, and we’re excited that several companies are joining us with support and contributions including Accenture, Anthropic, Langfuse, mem0.ai, Meta, PwC, Ragas.io, and Tavily. For instance, Anthropic has already contributed support in Strands for using models through the Anthropic API, and Meta contributed support for Llama models through Llama API. Join us on GitHub to get started with Strands Agents! Our journey building agents I primarily work on Amazon Q Developer, a generative AI-powered assistant for software development. My team and I started building AI agents in early 2023, around when the original ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) scientific paper was published. This paper showed that large language models could reason, plan, and take actions in their environment. For example, LLMs could reason that they needed to make an API call to complete a task and then generate the inputs needed for that API call. We then realized that large language models could be used as agents to complete many types of tasks, including complex software development and operational troubleshooting. At that time, LLMs weren’t typically trained to act like agents. They were often trained primarily for natural language conversation. Successfully using an LLM to reason and act required complex prompt instructions on how to use tools, parsers for the model’s responses, and orchestration logic. Simply getting LLMs to reliably produce syntactically correct JSON was a challenge at the time! To prototype and deploy agents, my team and I relied on a variety of complex agent framework libraries that handled the scaffolding and orchestration needed for the agents to reliably succeed at their tasks with these earlier models. Even with these frameworks, it would take us months of tuning and tweaking to get an agent ready for production. Since then, we’ve seen a dramatic improvement in large language models’ abilities to reason and use tools to complete tasks. We realized that we no longer needed such complex orchestration to build agents, because models now have native tool-use and reasoning capabilities. In fact, some of the agent framework libraries we had been using to build our agents started to get in our way of fully leveraging the capabilities of newer LLMs. Even though LLMs were getting dramatically better, those improvements didn’t mean we could build and iterate on agents any faster with the frameworks we were using. It still took us months to make an agent production-ready. We started building Strands Agents to remove this complexity for our teams in Q Developer. We found that relying on the latest models’ capabilities to drive agents significantly reduced our time to market and improved the end user experience, compared to building agents with complex orchestration logic. Where it used to take months for Q Developer teams to go from prototype to production with a new agent, we’re now able to ship new agents in days and weeks with Strands. Core concepts of Strands Agents The simplest definition of an agent is a combination of three things: 1) a model, 2) tools, and 3) a prompt. The agent uses these three components to complete a task, often autonomously. The agent’s task could be to answer a question, generate code, plan a vacation, or optimize your financial portfolio. In a model-driven approach, the agent uses the model to dynamically direct its own steps and to use tools in order to accomplish the specified task. To define an agent with the Strands Agents SDK, you define these three components in code: 1. Model: Strands offers flexible model support. You can use any model in Amazon Bedrock that supports tool use and streaming, a model from Anthropic’s Claude model family through the Anthropic API, a model from the Llama model family via Llama API, Ollama for local development, and many other model providers such as OpenAI through LiteLLM. You can additionally define your own custom model provider with Strands. 2. Tools: You can choose from thousands of published Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to use as tools for your agent. Strands also provides 20+ pre-built example tools, including tools for manipulating files, making API requests, and interacting with AWS APIs. You can easily use any Python function as a tool, by simply using the Strands @tool decorator. 3. Prompt: You provide a natural language prompt that defines the task for your agent, such as answering a question from an end user. You can also provide a system prompt that provides general instructions and desired behavior for the agent. An agent interacts with its model and tools in a loop until it completes the task provided by the prompt. This agentic loop is at the core of Strands’ capabilities. The Strands agentic loop takes full advantage of how powerful LLMs have become and how well they can natively reason, plan, and select tools. In each loop, Strands invokes the LLM with the prompt and agent context, along with a description of your agent’s tools. The LLM can choose to respond in natural language for the agent’s end user, plan out a series of steps, reflect on the agent’s previous steps, and/or select one or more tools to use. When the LLM selects a tool, Strands takes care of executing the tool and providing the result back to the LLM. When the LLM completes its task, Strands returns the agent’s final result. In Strands’ model-driven approach, tools are key to how you customize the behavior of your agents. For example, tools can retrieve relevant documents from a knowledge base, call APIs, run Python logic, or just simply return a static string that contains additional model instructions. Tools also help you achieve complex use cases in a model-driven approach, such as with these Strands Agents example pre-built tools: Retrieve tool: This tool implements semantic search using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. Beyond retrieving documents, the retrieve tool can also help the model plan and reason by retrieving other tools using semantic search. For example, one internal agent at AWS has over 6,000 tools to select from! Models today aren’t capable of accurately selecting from quite that many tools. Instead of describing all 6,000 tools to the model, the agent uses semantic search to find the most relevant tools for the current task and describes only those tools to the model. You can implement this pattern by storing many tool descriptions in a knowledge base and letting the model use the retrieve tool to retrieve a subset of relevant tools for the current task. Thinking tool: This tool prompts the model to do deep analytical thinking through multiple cycles, enabling sophisticated thought processing and self-reflection as part of the agent. In the model-driven approach, modeling thinking as a tool enables the model to reason about if and when a task needs deep analysis. Multi-agent tools like the workflow, graph, and swarm tools: For complex tasks, Strands can orchestrate across multiple agents in a variety of multi-agent collaboration patterns. By modeling sub-agents and multi-agent collaboration as tools, the model-driven approach enables the model to reason about if and when a task requires a defined workflow, graph, or swarm of sub-agents. Strands support for the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol for multi-agent applications is coming soon.\n\nLearn more by requesting a demo\n\n### Tavily Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n\n*   When was Tavily founded?\n\nTavily was founded in 2023.\n\n*   Where is Tavily's headquarters?\n\nTavily's headquarters is located at 315 West 36th Street, New York.\n\n*   Who are Tavily's competitors?\n\nCompetitors of Tavily include Dashworks, Klart AI, Instabase, Hercules, IKI AI and 7 more.\n\n[![Image 10: New call-to-action](https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/763793/44dc5cae-a986-48aa-996a-34cb6eef5c03.png)](https://cta-redirect.hubspot.com/cta/redirect/763793/44dc5cae-a986-48aa-996a-34cb6eef5c03?__hstc=168719870.b6de7ef7b61aafc85a09a71d316fd4e1.1750104727522.1750104727522.1750104727522.1&__hssc=168719870.1.1750104727522&__hsfp=3742643765)\n\nCompare Tavily to Competitors\n-----------------------------\n\n![Image 11: Glean Logo](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cbi-image-service-prd/original/8bd6d4bd-b376-4681-b438-61e45ca5ba65.png)\n\n[Glean](https://www.cbinsights.com/company/glean-2)\nGlean operates as an enterprise artificial intelligence (AI) platform that provides tools for workplace productivity across various sectors.
